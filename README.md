# Information
This is a simple weather app i build using react with functional component and hooks. It's my first proper
react project so check out.

# prerequisites
- node(v12.18.1 & above)
- npm(6.14.5 & above)

# how to run
- firstly clone the repo and extract in folder (folder name - you choose).
- open terminal (git bash i prefer).
- cd to the folder where all files exists.
- run #npm install or #npm i.
- after installation run #npm start.
- it automatically start the default browser and run the weather app.

$I like if you appreciate it and please don't judge me it's my first react project.
